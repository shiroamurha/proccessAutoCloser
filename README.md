# proccessAutoCloser
looping program that kills any proccess you want to
<br><br>
dump proccesses names on json-like coding (list) inside static.json, then run autocloser.exe at the same dir as static.json
<br><br>
OBS: python file is not needed
<br>
bugs: unfortunatelly i couldn't build an exec without the fkn black window, so it will appear every 10 sec :(
